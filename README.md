# Advent of Code
## Adventuring with Rust

### General Approach
Primarily the goal is to become exposed to Rust and its syntax, primitives, control flows, and `std` library.  Unlike previous years with other languages, there will not be significant effort to avoid external crates which provide helpful functionality beyond the 'base' language.

VSCode with Rust extension is utilized to program each Day's solution, with a build task utilized to run the solution and observe the output in the Terminal tab (io::stdout).

### Observations

[Rust's 'Learn Rust'](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has provided a great collection of resources.  'The book', Rust By Example, std library reference, and Docs.rs for various crate references have been thorough yet approachable.
